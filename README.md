Welcome to my first messenger!

This rudimentary app does not implement a login or authentication system, but rather focuses on the essential CRUD elements. 

The code also takes in the users light or dark mode preferences and adjusts the colour of the text to make it more readable depening on light or dark(darker colours for light backgrounds and more neon for dark backgrounds, while maintaining the same shade)
